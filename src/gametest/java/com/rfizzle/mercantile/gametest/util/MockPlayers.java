 * public, non-deprecated APIs: a real {@link Connection} backed by an
 * {@link EmbeddedChannel} (which absorbs sent packets), fully registered in the
 * player list via {@code placeNewPlayer}. The channel is handed back so tests
 * can read the packets the server sent — Mercantile's join-sync and HUD
 * payloads, for one. {@code MockPlayersGameTest} guards this faithfulness so a
 * later simplification fails loudly.
 *
 * <p>This is the connected replica only. {@code GameTestHelper#makeMockPlayer}
 * returns a lightweight stub that is never added to the level or the player
 * list, so it accrues none of the cost {@link #retire} releases and keeps its
 * plain {@code discard()}.
